    <h1>PyCaret Classification Tutorial</h1>

    <p>PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates the process of training and tuning machine learning models. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps to use PyCaret for classification on a custom dataset.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Setting Up the Environment</h2>

    <p>To get started, you'll need to install PyCaret. You can do this using pip:</p>

    <pre><code>pip install pycaret</code></pre>

    <p>Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. PyCaret automatically installs many dependencies, but you'll also need pandas and scikit-learn:</p>

    <pre><code>pip install pandas scikit-learn</code></pre>

    <h2>Step 2: Loading Your Custom Dataset</h2>

    <p>Assuming you have your custom dataset in a CSV file, you can load it using pandas:</p>

    <pre><code>import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())</code></pre>

    <p>Replace <code>'your_dataset.csv'</code> with the path to your dataset. Ensure that your dataset includes the features (input variables) and a target variable (the output you want to predict).</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Setting Up the PyCaret Environment</h2>

    <p>Before training your model, you'll need to set up the PyCaret environment. This involves specifying the target variable and the dataset:</p>

    <pre><code>from pycaret.classification import *

# Set up the PyCaret environment
clf = setup(data=data, target='target_variable')</code></pre>

    <p>Replace <code>'target_variable'</code> with the name of the column in your dataset that you want to predict.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Training and Comparing Models</h2>

    <p>PyCaret provides a simple way to train multiple classification models and compare their performance:</p>

    <pre><code># Train and compare models
best_model = compare_models()</code></pre>

    <p>This command will train several classification models and return the best one based on cross-validated performance.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Fine-Tuning the Best Model</h2>

    <p>Once you've identified the best model, you can fine-tune it to improve performance:</p>

    <pre><code># Tune the best model
tuned_model = tune_model(best_model)</code></pre>

    <p>PyCaret will automatically tune the hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize performance.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Evaluating the Model</h2>

    <p>After training and tuning your model, you can evaluate its performance using various metrics:</p>

    <pre><code># Evaluate the model
evaluate_model(tuned_model)</code></pre>

    <p>This will display a variety of plots and metrics to help you assess the performance of your model.</p>

    <h2>Step 7: Making Predictions</h2>

    <p>Finally, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new data:</p>

    <pre><code># Make predictions on new data
predictions = predict_model(tuned_model, data=new_data)</code></pre>

    <p>Replace <code>new_data</code> with the dataset you want to make predictions on. This dataset should have the same structure as the one used for training, except it won't include the target variable.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>In this tutorial, we covered how to use PyCaret for classification on a custom dataset. PyCaret simplifies the machine learning workflow, making it easier to build and evaluate models with minimal code.
